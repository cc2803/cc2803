- 👋 Hi, I’m @cc2803
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Data Science and Signal Processing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frameworks and libraries like scikit-learn, keras, seaborn, and matplotlib.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to data analysis, model building, or any AI applications where I can contribute. I love to involve myself with educational python projects that I can use to teach aspiring, rookie coders/developers and strengthen me conceptually.
- I am an avid learner and look forward to explore new horizons and have fun contributing something useful while I'm at it 😁
